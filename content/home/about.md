# A little bit about myself

I am a PhD student of Statistics in Oklahoma State University. I truly believe in the power of education. Through teaching and learning, I am able to exchange ideas and knowledge. This helps me and many of my friends. Research is also my hobby. By exploring and experimenting with new things, I can expand my life experience, enjoy the ups and downs when taking on new challeges, and learn new things.
Music, reading, traveling and spending time with the people I love and who love me are my hobbies.
